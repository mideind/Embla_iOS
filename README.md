# Embla iOS client

Embla, an iOS app to access the [Greynir](https://github.com/mideind/Reynir) query engine via voice.

Requires iOS 10.0+. Probably only builds on a relatively recent version of macOS.

## Build instructions

Building the app requires Xcode 10+ and a recent version of [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

From repository root, run the following command:

```
$ pod install
```

Once installation is done, open `Embla.xcworkspace` with Xcode and build. Alternatively, you can build an unsigned app binary by running the following command from the repository root:

```
./build.sh
```

NB: In order to function correctly, the app requires a valid API key for Google's Speech API. The key should be saved in the following text file:

* `Keys/GoogleAPI.key`
