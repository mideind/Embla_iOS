TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Option to use HR's Kaldi speech recognition API instead of Google's? - https://tal.ru.is/
* Privacy notification on app setup/onboarding (show blurb about not storing personally identifiable information)
* We need new sound files for recording notifications. Currently using Apple's Siri sounds.
* Stream MP3 directly from Polly service instead of downloading prior to playback? Might accelerate time to playback slightly.
* Acc. to Google, FLAC is the recommended encoding for streaming speech (reduces bandwidth use by 50%).
  Is fast FLAC encoding viable on iOS? Battery life vs. bandwidth tradeoff.
* Pre-set vocabulary to improve speech recognition results? Doesn't seem to work all that well.
* More robust type validation of data received from server.
* Fix Travis CI build
* Fade out text on scroll in web views
* Local file fallback if unable to fetch HTML from remote server in web views
* Only show query server selection in Settings if debug build

DONE * Don't use 10.13-only SFSymbols in UI
DONE * UI element to disable voice activation in Main View
DONE * Fade out text on scroll in text view
DONE * Location sending is flaky when re-enabled, fix that.
DONE * Obfuscate Google API key instead of including it as a file in the app bundle
DONE * Change build process so that missing API key doesn't break build.
DONE * Don't show English-language server errors in production build
DONE * Render about text as an HTML web view, with text fetched from server? (plus local fallback)
DONE * Add "Privacy Mode"
DONE * Add ability to delete queries logged from client device
DONE * Ability to open URLs provided by the server?
DONE * "Hætta"/"Hætta við" trigger to abort query (text not sent to query server)
DONE * Automatic activation on some prompt-word, like "Hey Embla".
DONE * Send device ID with requests to query server
DONE * Standardise query API, remove everything not needed, e.g. image lookup.
DONE * Button icon should change depending on the state of the query session (i.e. recording, querying, responding)
DONE * Handle ill-formed API replies gracefully
DONE * Handle location services on/off switching more intelligently
DONE * Show interim speech recognition results
DONE * Add cutoff point for rec. session duration, say 5-10 seconds, after which the session is terminated
DONE * Add sounds for when recording ends/speech recognition fails
DONE * Laga end of speech utterance event handling
DONE * Send all speech recognition results to query server.
DONE * Handle reachability.
DONE * Handle app resignActive more gracefully.
DONE * Conflict wrt waveform, init sound & using decibel level in mic. Use separate audio player?
DONE * Implement settings, incl. voice selection (Karl, Dóra), location services (On/Off), API endpoint (default https://greynir.is), "Restore defaults"
DONE * Move initial url signing communication with AWS Polly to Greynir server to reduce latency
DONE * Hardcoded responses should be stored as local audio files in app (e.g. "Það veit ég ekki", "Ekki næst samband við netið.")
DONE * Play sound on recording activation
DONE * Send location info w. query
