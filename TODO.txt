TODO list for Greynir iOS app

* Move communication with AWS Polly to Greynir server to reduce latency
* Automatic activation on prompt-word, like "Hey Siri"
* Hardcoded responses should be stored as audio files in app (e.g. "Það veit ég ekki", "Ekki næst samband við netið.")
* Voice selection
* Tied to user account?
* Play sound on recording activation
* Location info
* Privacy notification on app setup/onboarding (some blurb about not storing personally identifiable information)
