TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Option to use HR's Kaldi speech recognition API instead of Google's? - https://tal.ru.is/
* Stream MP3 directly from Polly service instead of downloading prior to playback? Might accelerate time to playback slightly, at the risk of interrupted or imperfect playback on slow networks.
* Fix Bluetooth audio input/output source switching (semi-broken, it seems, but difficult to reproduce)
* Onboarding/Intro view when app is first launched
* More accurate dB measurement (accumulate and calculate average dB level instead of grabbing the exact value at the given moment)
* Pick another icon for muting voice activation in main view? Microphone perhaps too generic?
* Use AFNetworking's Reachability instead of Reachability lib
* Automatic text size adjustment via Dynamic Type (fix for Lato custom font)
