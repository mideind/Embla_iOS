TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Option to use HR's Kaldi speech recognition API instead of Google's? - https://tal.ru.is/
* Stream MP3 directly instead of downloading prior to playback? Might accelerate time to playback slightly, at the risk of interrupted or imperfect playback on slow networks.
* Fix Bluetooth audio input/output source switching (semi-broken, it seems, but difficult to reproduce)
* Onboarding/Intro view when app is first launched
* Pick another icon for muting voice activation in main view? Microphone perhaps too generic?
