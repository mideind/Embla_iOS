TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Option to use HR's Kaldi speech recognition API instead of Google's? - https://tal.ru.is/
* Pick another icon for muting voice activation in main view? Microphone perhaps too generic?

* Fix Bluetooth audio input/output source switching (semi-broken, it seems, but difficult to reproduce)
* Onboarding/Intro view when app is first launched
* Add beta version in corner in main view
