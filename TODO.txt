TODO list for Greynir iOS app

* Tied to Greynir user account?
* Privacy notification on app setup/onboarding (show some blurb about not storing personally identifiable information)
* Handle reachability.
    * There should be no unexpected behaviour when internet connection fails at any stage.
    * Ping server specified in settings to determine reachability? Or Google? Both are required.
* Handle app resignActive more gracefully.
* Automatic activation on some prompt-word, like "Hey Siri"
* Ignore responses from old requests instead of re-triggering query/playback pipeline (i.e. store current session ID)
* Server-side should identify natural language queries, respond with "I don't understand the question" if the query is just a statement
* We need new sound files for recording notifications. Currently using Apple's assets for Siri.
* Currently, only the speech recognition result with the highest probability is sent to query server. Add another layer of logic server-side to pick best match?
* Standardise query API

* Conflict wrt waveform, init sound & using decibel level in mic. Use separate audio player?
* Add cutoff point for rec. session duration, say 5-10 seconds, after which the session is terminated
* Add sounds for when recording ends/speech recognition fails
* Fyrirspurnaslóð, ekki fyrirspurnaþjónn. Why not offer an arbitrary endpoint?

DONE * Implement settings, incl. voice selection (Karl, Dóra), location services (On/Off), API endpoint (default https://greynir.is), "Restore defaults"
DONE * Move initial url signing communication with AWS Polly to Greynir server to reduce latency
DONE * Hardcoded responses should be stored as local audio files in app (e.g. "Það veit ég ekki", "Ekki næst samband við netið.")
DONE * Play sound on recording activation
DONE * Send location info w. query
