TODO list for Greynir iOS app

* Tied to Greynir user account?
* Privacy notification on app setup/onboarding (show some blurb about not storing personally identifiable information)
* Handle reachability. Don't break when internet connection fails at any stage.
* Automatic activation on prompt-word, like "Hey Siri"
* Ignore responses from old requests instead of re-triggering query/playback pipeline
* Server-side should identify natural language queries, respond "I don't understand the question" if query is just a statement
* We need new sound files for recording notifications. Currently using Apple's assets for Siri.

* Add sounds for when recording ends/speech recognition fails

* Fyrirspurnaslóð, ekki fyrirspurnaþjónn. Hví ekki arbitrary endpoint?

DONE * Implement settings, incl. voice selection (Karl, Dóra), location services (On/Off), API endpoint (default https://greynir.is), "Restore defaults"

DONE * Move initial url signing communication with AWS Polly to Greynir server to reduce latency
DONE * Hardcoded responses should be stored as local audio files in app (e.g. "Það veit ég ekki", "Ekki næst samband við netið.")
DONE * Play sound on recording activation
DONE * Send location info w. query
