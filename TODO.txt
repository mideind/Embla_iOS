TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Option to use HR's Kaldi speech recognition API instead of Google's? - https://tal.ru.is/
* We need new sound files for recording notifications. Currently using Apple's Siri sounds (Halld√≥r)
* Stream MP3 directly from Polly service instead of downloading prior to playback? Might accelerate time to playback slightly, at the risk of interrupted or imperfect playback on slow networks.
* Pre-set vocabulary to improve speech recognition results? Doesn't seem to work all that well.
* Fix Bluetooth audio input/output source switching (semi-broken, it seems)
* Onboarding/Intro view when app is first launched
* More accurate dB measurement (accumulate and average out dB level instead of grabbing the exact value at the given moment)
* Pick another icon for muting voice activation? Microphone perhaps too generic?
* Use AFNetworking's Reachability instead of Reachability lib

DONE * Add BETA logo to bottom of main view
DONE * Fix AFNetworking's use of UIWebView
