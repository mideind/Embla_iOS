TODO list for Embla iOS app

* Future roadmap: Log into user account?
* Privacy notification on app setup/onboarding (show blurb about not storing personally identifiable information)
* We need new sound files for recording notifications. Currently using Apple's Siri sounds.
* Pre-set vocabulary to improve speech recognition results? Doesn't seem to work all that well.
* More robust type validation of data received from server.
* Obfuscate Google API key instead of including it as a file in app bundle
* Render about text as an HTML web view, with text fetched from server? (plus local fallback)

DONE * Add "Privacy Mode"
DONE * Add ability to delete queries logged from client device
DONE * Ability to open URLs provided by the server?
DONE * "Hætta"/"Hætta við" trigger to abort query (text not sent to query server)
DONE * Automatic activation on some prompt-word, like "Hey Embla".
DONE * Send device ID with requests to query server
DONE * Standardise query API, remove everything not needed, e.g. image lookup.
DONE * Button icon should change depending on the state of the query session (i.e. recording, querying, responding)
DONE * Handle ill-formed API replies gracefully
DONE * Handle location services on/off switching more intelligently
DONE * Show interim speech recognition results
DONE * Add cutoff point for rec. session duration, say 5-10 seconds, after which the session is terminated
DONE * Add sounds for when recording ends/speech recognition fails
DONE * Laga end of speech utterance event handling
DONE * Send all speech recognition results to query server.
DONE * Handle reachability.
DONE * Handle app resignActive more gracefully.
DONE * Conflict wrt waveform, init sound & using decibel level in mic. Use separate audio player?
DONE * Implement settings, incl. voice selection (Karl, Dóra), location services (On/Off), API endpoint (default https://greynir.is), "Restore defaults"
DONE * Move initial url signing communication with AWS Polly to Greynir server to reduce latency
DONE * Hardcoded responses should be stored as local audio files in app (e.g. "Það veit ég ekki", "Ekki næst samband við netið.")
DONE * Play sound on recording activation
DONE * Send location info w. query
